PSC 324LEC - Politics and Technology
This course investigates the intersection between technology and contemporary politics. Technological advances have altered many political processes and the way in which we study and approach mass political behavior, especially in areas such as political communication, elections, and citizen participation. Technology has affected the basic functioning of government and international affairs, creating new questions surrounding personal surveillance and international security. This course will address these topics as well as investigating how technology has changed the study of politics and the implications these changes have on political institutions and individual behavior. The course addresses these topics theoretically in a manner that allows for application across different political systems, while also relating traditional topics in comparative politics to new research, focusing on the influence of technology on political behavior and institutions.
